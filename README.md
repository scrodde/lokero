About
======================

 The Lokero project made it to the top 10 finalist in [Asko Foundation's](http://askonsaatio.fi/) 50th anniversary year [Home Revisited design competition](http://askonsaatio.fi/homerevisited/). The competition strived to make us understand what future homes will be like by generating new commercially significant products that meet the needs of future residents.

The Lokero service consists of a modular locker furniture system, Arduino based locking system and an iOS application. This repository contains the code for the Arduino locking system and the React-Native iOS service UI. The iOS application is connected over Bluetooth to the Arduino.

## Usage

### iOS app
```
git clone https://github.com/scrodde/lokero
cd lokero
